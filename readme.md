# Weather App in Rust

## Introduction
This weather app is designed as a learning project to further my skills in the Rust programming language. It's a simple, yet functional app that provides current weather information.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to progress my learning in the Rust programming language, understand API interaction, and handle JSON data in a type-safe manner, as well as creating a GUI using Druid.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [x] **City-Based Weather Retrieval**: Users can input a city name to receive the current day's weather information.
- [x] **Graphical User Interface**: The app GUI will be created using Druid.
- [x] **API Integration**: Establishes a connection with a weather API to fetch and display various data points related to the weather conditions.

## Bonus Features
- **Dynamic Weather Backgrounds**: The app will dynamically change its background to match the current weather conditions, such as displaying raindrops for rainy weather.
- **Extended Forecasts**: Offers a 7-day weather forecast, allowing users to plan their week around the upcoming weather conditions.

## Features
- Fetch and display current weather data
- Customizable location input

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Rust programming environment set up
